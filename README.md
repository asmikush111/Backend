This repo is for Login and Registeration Authentication with jwt token, Node JS and cloud MongoDB Atlas.

=> I have used cloud Mongo atlas for Database connectivity and storing data.
=> Created an API with Login and Register functionality with jwt token Authentication.
=> Registration API fields require First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Email, Password, Confirm Password and profile photo.
=> Login API fields require only Email and Password.
=> All fields have back-end validation.
=> I am using postman to test my API like localhost:5000/register and localhost:5000/login. Front-end is not required here.
